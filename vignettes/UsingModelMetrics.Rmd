ModelMetrics is designed to be much faster than the alternatives but also strives to be simple to use.

```{r}
library(ModelMetrics)

glmModel <- glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = testDF, family = 'binomial')

probs <- predict(glmModel, type = 'response')

## Area under the curve
auc(actual = testDF$y, predicted = probs)

## LogLoss
logLoss(actual = testDF$y, predicted = probs)

## RMSE
rmse(actual = testDF$y, predicted = probs)

```

There are also a couple S3 methods that save a bit of code writing.

```{r}

## Area under the curve
auc(glmModel)

## LogLoss
logLoss(glmModel)

## RMSE
rmse(glmModel)

```
